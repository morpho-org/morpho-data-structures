# Morpho Data Structures 🦋

This repository contains the data structures that can be used for the Morpho's matching engine 🦋.
The goal is to compare them in terms of security and gas consumption to find the best solution for the protocol and its users.

# Data structures

The data structures we implement and modified are based on public works of amazing developers. We thank them for what they have done 🙏

You can refer to the following table for the complexity of some data structures.

## Double Linked List

The current implementation of the double linked list is based on this [article](https://hackernoon.com/a-linked-list-implementation-for-ethereum-deep-dive-oy9432pa) written by Alberto Cuesta Cañada. You can find the repository [here](https://github.com/HQ20/contracts/tree/master/contracts/lists). Note that the code has been modified to meet our own needs and to allow us to sort the first accounts of the double linked list. Our implementation is not a generalised one.
What you can with it:

- Insert an address sorted by a value passed along this address.
- Insert (and its value) before an account.

## Red Black Binary Tree

A [Red Black Binary Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree) is a kind of binary tree that allows insertion / deletion / search in `O(log(n))`.
Our implementation is a modified version of the [OrderStatisticsTree repository](https://github.com/rob-Hitchens/OrderStatisticsTree) written by [Rob Hitechn](https://github.com/rob-Hitchens) which is also based on [BokkyPooBahsRedBlackTreeLibrary repository](https://github.com/bokkypoobah/BokkyPooBahsRedBlackTreeLibrary) written by [bokkypoobah](https://github.com/bokkypoobah).
Our modified version makes keys unique items instead of just (key, value) unique pairs.

In order to manipulate a binary tree and visualize how it manages to stay balanced, this [tool](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/RedBlack.html) is very useful. You can also find [here](http://ion.uwinnipeg.ca/~ychen2/advancedAD/Red-black%20Tree.pdf) the pseudo-code logic of the tree's function.

## Heap based ordering

This implementation is based on a heap data structure, and refines it by adding an unsorted portion after it. This gives us an approximation of a heap, and thus operations are performed in constant time. The main entry point is the `update` function, calling internally either `insert`, `increase`, `decrease` or `remove`.

## Other data structures

Other data structures may be explored in the future and we are open to any suggestions or optimisation of current implementations ⚡️

# Contributing

In this section, you will find some guidelines to read before contributing to the project.

## Setup

Update git submodules:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Run yarn:

```
yarn
```

## Testing

The tests can be run with [foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry).

For the `RedBlackBinaryTree`, you can run the tests with hardhat with `yarn test`.

## Creating issues and PRs

Guidelines for creating issues and PRs:

- Issues must be created and labelled with relevant labels (type of issues, high/medium/low priority, etc.).
- Nothing should be pushed directly to the `main` branch.
- Pull requests must be created before and branch names must follow this pattern: `feat/<feature-name>`, `test/<test-name>` or `fix/<fix-name>`. `docs`, `ci` can also be used. The goal is to have clear branches names and make easier their management.
- PRs must be labelled with the relevant labels.
- Issues must be linked to PRs so that once the PR is merged related issues are closed at the same time.
- Reviewers must be added to the PR.
- For commits, we use the bitmoji VS Code extension 🙃

## Before merging a PR

Before merging a PR:

- PR must have been reviewed by reviewers. The must deliver a complete report on the smart contracts (see the section below).
- Comments and requested changes must have been resolved.
- PR must have been approved by every reviewers.
- CI must pass.

## Code Formatting

We use Husky hook to format code before being pushed to any remote branch to enforce coding style among all developers.

# Audits

The code concerning the [heap based ordering data-structure](./contracts/HeapOrdering.sol) has been audited by [Omniscia](https://omniscia.io) and the report can be found [online](https://omniscia.io/reports/morpho-heap-ordering-structure/) or in the file [Morpho_Omniscia](./audits/Morpho_Omniscia.pdf).
